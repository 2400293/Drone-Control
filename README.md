# Project details
This repository contains the modelling, analysis, and control design of a quadcopter system developed for a Mechatronics II assignment. It includes non-linear and linearised dynamic models, stability analysis and the design and simulation of PID-based control strategies. MATLAB/Simulink is used to compare linear vs non-linear behaviour, evaluate system stability and implement trajectory control for realistic drone operation scenarios.

# How to run
1. Open MATLAB
2. Set the current folder to the repository directory
3. Run: OneClickSimulationForMatLab
4. Watch the plots and 3D trajectory

No additional toolboxes are required.
